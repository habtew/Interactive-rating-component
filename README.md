I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive rating template. I used HTML to create the structure and layout of the template, including elements that the JavaScript interacts with. I used CSS to add visual styles, create a responsive design and enhance the visual design of the template. Finally, I used JavaScript to make the template interactive by adding click event handlers to the rating spans and the button and to display the selected rating in a "thank you" message.
